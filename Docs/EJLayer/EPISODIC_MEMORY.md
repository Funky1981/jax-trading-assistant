# Episodic Memory

## Purpose
Persist market episodes representing full decision contexts, including abstentions.

An episode is not a trade.

## Episode Includes
- timestamp
- market context snapshot
- candidate strategy or abstention
- expectations
- confidence level
- action taken
- outcome (if applicable)
- hindsight evaluation
- surprise score
- context dominance tags
- decay metadata

Episodes decay over time and reinforce with repetition.
