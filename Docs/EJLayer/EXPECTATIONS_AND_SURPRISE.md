# Expectations & Surprise

## Purpose
Enable learning from expectation mismatch, not just P&L.

## Expectations Model
Before action:
- expected direction
- expected magnitude range
- expected volatility behavior
- expected time horizon
- anticipated failure modes

## Surprise Scoring
After resolution:
- directional deviation
- magnitude deviation
- timing deviation
- volatility mismatch

Surprise influences confidence and memory weighting.
