# Phase 2 – Experience & Judgment Layer

## Objective
Upgrade Jax from a system that evaluates decisions into a system that accumulates experience while remaining deterministic and risk-first.

## Core Philosophy
Jax should get wiser without getting bolder.

Experience informs:
- confidence
- caution
- abstention

Experience must never:
- override guardrails
- invent strategies
- self-modify rules
- drive execution directly
