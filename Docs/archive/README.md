# Documentation Archive

This directory stores historical reports, phase writeups, and redundant documents that were consolidated into current summaries.

## Docs Snapshot

The `docs-original/` folder contains a full snapshot of the `Docs/` tree (excluding the archive itself) to preserve the original documentation layout before consolidation.

Use this archive for full context or audit trails. Current, condensed references live in `Docs/` and are indexed in `Docs/README.md`.
