# Jax Trading Dashboard (React)

This folder contains the React-based dashboard for Jax, an AI-assisted trading system.

The dashboard is a professional trading cockpit, not a marketing site.
Design priorities are: performance, clarity, correctness, and extensibility.

---

## Core Technology Stack

The dashboard MUST be built with the following libraries and constraints.

### Framework
- React (functional components only)
- TypeScript (strict mode enabled)

---

## UI & Styling

### shadcn/ui
- Use shadcn/ui for base UI components (buttons, dialogs, dropdowns, tabs, etc.)
- Components are copied into the codebase and fully owned by the project
- Do NOT install large UI frameworks (no MUI, no Ant Design)

### Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind CSS is the ONLY styling system
- No CSS-in-JS libraries
- No styled-components
- Utility-first approach is required

### Layout Rules
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox only
- Do NOT use layout libraries or dashboard templates
- Layout should be explicit and readable in code

### Dark Mode (Mandatory)
- Dark mode is the default and primary theme
- Light mode is optional but secondary
- Use Tailwind’s `dark` class strategy
- All components must be readable and usable in dark mode

---

## Charts & Visualisation

### TradingView Lightweight Charts
- Use TradingView Lightweight Charts for:
  - Price charts
  - Candlestick charts
  - Time-series market data
- Charts must be performant with large datasets
- Charts should be isolated React components

### Rejected
- Do NOT use Chart.js, D3, or Recharts for price data
- Lightweight Charts is the standard for market visuals

---

## Tables & Data Grids

### TanStack Table
- Use TanStack Table for all tabular data
- Examples:
  - Trade history
  - Open positions
  - Signals
  - Strategy performance
- Tables must support:
  - Sorting
  - Filtering
  - Pagination
  - Derived/computed columns

No table UI libraries allowed.

---

## Data Fetching & State

### TanStack Query
- Use TanStack Query for ALL server data
- No manual useEffect data fetching
- No Redux for server state
- Handle:
  - Polling
  - Caching
  - Background refetching
  - Error and loading states

### State Rules
- Server state → TanStack Query
- Local UI state → React state
- Avoid global state unless clearly necessary

---

## Project Structure (Guideline)

Suggested structure (not strict, but preferred):

src/
  components/
    ui/              # shadcn/ui components
    charts/          # TradingView chart components
    tables/          # TanStack Table wrappers
  features/
    trades/
    signals/
    strategies/
    risk/
  hooks/
  lib/
    api.ts           # API client
    queryClient.ts   # TanStack Query setup
  styles/
  pages/

## Design Philosophy

- This is a trading system UI, not a consumer app
- Dense but readable layouts are acceptable
- Prefer clarity over decoration
- Every screen should answer:
  - What is happening?
  - Why is it happening?
  - What is the risk?

---

## Non-Goals

- No animations for decoration
- No heavy theming systems
- No autogenerated dashboards
- No visual noise

---

## Copilot Instructions

When generating code:
- Follow this README as a hard requirement
- Prefer small, composable components
- Avoid abstraction unless reused
- Optimize for readability and debuggability

If a choice conflicts with this README, this README wins.
